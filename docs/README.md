# QuestSpace DAO (EN)

QuestSpace is a hackerspace & co-working in Ko≈°ice where we cultivate a community of people with common interests such as computers, technology, science and art. It offers an inclusive space where people can meet, share information, learn and collaborate.

We want our member to own part the community and participate on its governance in a decentralized way. DAOs allow us to experiment with new incentivization models where community members can use the crypto-based representation of their monthly subscription fee to vote on different matters. Your community contribution and duration of your paid membership gives you a weighted stake in the DAO governance.
